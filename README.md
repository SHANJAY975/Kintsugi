# PROBLEM STATEMENT
It is extremely difficult for students from different disciplines within the same college to exchange information. We created an app named "KINTSUGI" with a few extra capabilities to help us get around that. 
Alternatively, it can be called as "THE EVERYTHING APP."

# Novelty and other Interactive features
 It connects students of similar mindset , notifies every information that a student needs , control will be not with any third party organization and the major attraction is the “ VERTICAL SCROLLING” , because vertical scrolling is very addictive now-a-days. So the app will not be boring to use. The student will also be able to post their unique talent in our app.
 So, What else is needed for a student in their college days!!
